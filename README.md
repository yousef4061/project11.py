## Overview 
This repository contains three Python projects designed for managing time, fractions, and basic mathematical calculations. They are combined to help you handle various tasks efficiently.

## projects
### 1. Time Management (File: test3.py)
. **Description**: A Time class to manage hours, minutes, and seconds.

. **Features** :

  - Automatically adjusts time (e.g., excess seconds convert to minutes).
  - Displays time in HH: MM: SS format.

. **Use Case** : Ideal for time-tracking applications.

. **How to Run** : Open test3.py and run python test3.py.

### 2. Fraction Management (File: test2.py)

. **Description** : A Fraction class for working with fractions.

. **Features** :

- Addition and multiplication of fractions.
- Auto-simplifies fractions (e.g., 2/4 to 1/2).
- Displays fractions as s/m.

. **Use Case** : Useful for mathematical calculations with fractions.

. **How to Run** : Open test2.py and run python test2.py.

### 3. Fraction Calculations (File: test1.py)

. **Description** : Functions for addition, multiplication, and converting fractions to decimals.

. **Features** :

- sum: Adds two fractions.
- mul: Multiplies two fractions.
- fraction_to_number: Converts a fraction to a decimal (checks for division by zero).
- Auto-simplifies results.
. **Use Case** : Quick fraction calculations without a class.
. **How to Run** :Open test1.py and run python test1.py.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- A code editor like VS Code (optional).

## How to Run
1. Open the desired file (test1.py, test2.py, or test3.py).
2. In the terminal, run python filename.py(e.g., python test1.py).
3. Check the output and enjoy!

## Notes
- If you encounter errors(e.g., division by zero), check initial values(e.g., avoid setting denominators to zero).
- Edit the code add features or test changes.
